# COVID19CalculatorRisk

I developed a COVID 19 Risk Calculator that is based on real factors of consideration, to determine a person's risk of getting coronavirus.

Bugs: There are no known bugs.

Execution: The GUI is linked in my repository, and all of the functioning code can be found there.

Description: The program takes in various health and wellbeing factors of a person and calculates a "score" which determines how at risk a person is of getting coronavirus.
